# SQL Zoo Database Design 
## Description
This project involves creating a database named "Assign2W24" in Microsoft SQL Server based on the provided physical schema (attached in Assign2W24ERD). The database will be populated with relevant data and queried to fulfill various tasks outlined below.

## Tasks

#### Database Creation
Using Microsoft SQL Server, create a database.

#### Database Setup
Define all primary keys, foreign keys, and populate the tables with sufficient data to adequately test all aspects of the queries.

#### SQL Queries
Develop SQL queries to address various tasks such as:

- Counting different species represented by captive animals for each zoo.
- Listing zoo name, employee name, and salary of world's best experts in a species.
- Showing details of captive animals with mothers in the "Garden Zoo" in Boston.
- Displaying counts of captive animals for Canadian zoos.
- Listing employees in Canadian zoos with specific salary or expertise criteria.
- Extracting details of animals born in 2016 belonging to endangered species.
- Providing details of zoos in China with multiple Panda animals.
- And more, including querying about species, zoos, employees, and animal relationships.

#### Populate Database
Ensure queries generate sufficient output and meet the following criteria:

All queries must generate some output.
Queries with explicit sequencing (order by clause) must return a minimum of 3 rows.
An aggregate query must have at least one row of output that is using at least 2 input rows (e.g., a count of 2, not 0 or 1).
Use column aliases where appropriate.
Suppress duplicate rows where appropriate for output based on your actual test data results, even if not specifically requested by the question.
